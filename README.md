This is the git repo for Tan & Jaeger *Learning to understand an unfamiliar talker: Testing models of adaptive speech perception*. The scripts/ folder contains the R Markdown that both the paper and the supplementary information (SI) are based on. The raw data can be found under data/. The Javascript code, stimuli, and websites used to collect the data can be found under experiments/. The Praat scripts and recordings that were used to create the stimuli for the experiments can be found under materials/.

Both the main text and these supplementary information (SI) are derived from the same R markdown document available via [https://osf.io/hxcy4/](OSF). It is best viewed using Acrobat Reader. The document was compiled using \texttt{knitr} in RStudio with R.

You will also need to download the IPA font [SIL Doulos](https://software.sil.org/doulos/download/) and a Latex environment like (e.g., [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) or the R library \texttt{tinytex}).
