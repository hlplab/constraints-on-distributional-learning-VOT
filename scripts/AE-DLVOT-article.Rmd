abstract: |
  Human speech perception is a computational feat<!-- ---automatic speech recognition systems trained on more words than most humans will experience in their lifetime are just beginning to approach the robustness listeners effortlessly exhibit in everyday language understanding. --> Now recognized as critical to this human ability is *adaptivity*: a few minutes of exposure can significantly reduce the processing difficulty listeners experience during initial encounters with an unfamiliar accent. How such adaptation unfolds incrementally, however, remains largely unknown, leaving basic predictions by theories of adaptive speech perception untested. We address this knowledge gap in a novel incremental distributional learning paradigm. We expose US English listeners to shifted phonetic distributions of word-initial /d/ and /t/, while incrementally assessing cumulative changes in listeners' perception. We use Bayesian mixed-effects psychometric model to characterize changes in listeners' categorization behavior, and compare these changes against both idealized learners (ideal observers that know the exposure statistics) and ideal learners (ideal adaptors that have to infer those statistics). These analyses find support for many predictions of distributional learning accounts of adaptive speech perception---including the integration of exposure statistics with prior expectations. Our analyses do, however, also suggest previously unrecognized limits on adaptivity that would not seem to follow from existing theories.
