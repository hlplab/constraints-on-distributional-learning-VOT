# Introduction
Talkers vary in the way they realise linguistic categories. Yet, listeners who share a common language background typically cope with talker variability without difficulty. In scenarios where a talker produces those categories in an unexpected and unfamiliar way comprehension may become a real challenge. It has been shown, however that brief exposure to unfamiliar accents can be sufficient for the listener to overcome any initial comprehension difficulty [e.g. @bradlow2008perceptual; @clarke2004rapid; @xie2018rapid; @xie2021cross].  This adaptive skill is in a sense, trivial for any expert language user but becomes complex when considered from the angle of acoustic-cue-to-linguistic-category mappings. Since talkers differ in countless ways and each listening occasion is different in circumstance, there is not a single set of cues that can be definitively mapped to each linguistic category. Listeners instead have to contend with many possible cue-to-category mappings and infer the intended category of the talker. How listeners achieve prompt and robust comprehension of speech in spite of this variability (the classic "lack of invariance" problem) remains the a longstanding question in speech perception research.

In the past two decades the hypothesis that listeners overcome the lack of invariance by learning the distributions of acoustic cue-to- phonetic category mappings has gained considerable influence in contemporary approaches to studying this problem. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that changes in listener behaviour through the course of a short experiment aligns with the statistics of exposure stimuli [@clayards2008perception, @kleinschmidt2015robust, @kleinschmidt2016you, @theodore2019distributional  etc] suggesting a possible change in cue-to-category mappings. 






--WHAT'S NEW HERE--
The study we report here builds on the pioneering work of @clayards2008perception and @kleinschmidt2016you with the aim to shed more light on the role of prior implicit knowledge on adaptation to an unfamiliar talker.

Specifically, while K&J16 demonstrated how prior beliefs of listeners can be inferred computationally from post-exposure categorisation, their experiment was not designed to capture listener categorisation data before exposure to a novel talker. Nor did they run intermittent tests to scrutinise the progress of adaptation. In the ideal adapter framework, listener expectations are predicted to  be rationally updated through integration with the incoming speech input and thus can theoretically be analysed on a trial-by-trial basis. The overall design of the studies reported here were motivated by our aim to understand this incremental belief-updating process which has not been closely studied in previous work. We thus address the limitations of previous work and in conjunction, make use of ideal observer models to validate baseline assumptions that accompany this kind of speech perception study -- that listeners hold prior expectations or beliefs about cue distributions based on previously experienced speech input (here taken to mean native AE listeners' lifetime of experience with AE). Arriving at a definitive conclusion of what shape and form those beliefs take is beyond the scope of this study however we attempt to explore the various proposals that have emerged from more than half a century of speech perception research.

A secondary aim was to begin to address possible concerns of ecological validity of prior work. While no speech stimuli is ever ideal, previous work on which the current study is based did have limitations in one or two aspects:the artificiality of the stimuli or the artificiality of the distributions. For e.g. [@clayards2008perception] and [@kleinschmidt2016you] made use of synthesised stimuli that were robotic or did not sound human-like. The second way that those studies were limited was that the exposure distributions of the linguistic categories had identical variances [see also @theodore2019distributional] unlike what is found in production data where the variance of the voiceless categories are typically wider than that of the voiced category [@chodroff2017structure]. We take modest steps to begin to improve the ecological validity of this study while balancing the need for control through lab experiments by employing more natural sounding stimuli as well as by setting the variances of our exposure distributions to better reflect empirical data on production (see section x.xx. of SI).
