# Introduction
Talkers vary in the way they realise linguistic categories. Yet, listeners who share a common language background typically cope with talker variability without difficulty. In scenarios where a talker produces those categories in an unexpected and unfamiliar way comprehension may become a real challenge. It has been shown, however that brief exposure to unfamiliar accents can be sufficient for the listener to overcome any initial comprehension difficulty [e.g. @bradlow2008perceptual; @clarke2004rapid; @xie2018rapid; @xie2021cross].  This adaptive skill is in a sense, trivial for any expert language user but becomes complex when considered from the angle of acoustic-cue-to-linguistic-category mappings. Since talkers differ in countless ways and each listening occasion is different in circumstance, there is not a single set of cues that can be definitively mapped to each linguistic category. Listeners instead have to contend with many possible cue-to-category mappings and infer the intended category of the talker. How listeners achieve prompt and robust comprehension of speech in spite of this variability (the classic "lack of invariance" problem) remains the a longstanding question in speech perception research.

In the past two decades the hypothesis that listeners overcome the lack of invariance by learning the distributions of talkers' acoustic cue-to-linguistic category mappings has gained considerable influence in contemporary approaches to studying this problem. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that changes in listener behaviour through the course of a short experiment align qualitatively with the statistics of exposure stimuli [@clayards2008perception; @kleinschmidt2015robust; @kleinschmidt2016you; @theodore2019distributional  etc]. 

For example when listeners are tasked with identifying word pairs contrasted by the voice-onset-time (VOT) cue (e.g. "beach-peach") they would exhibit categorisation behaviour that corresponds to theproperties of the distributions from where these words are sampled. Listeners exposed to tokens from a distribution with wide variance tend to have categorisation functions that are shallower than listeners who hear words sampled from a narrow variance (@clayards2008perception; @theodore2019distributional). In such paradigms, the mean of each sound category are held constant usually at locations where listeners would expect.
To a certain extent listener categorisation is responsive to shifts in mean values. @kleinschmidt2016you tested listener response to talker statistics by shifting the means of the voiced and voiceless categories between conditions. Specifically, the mean values for /b/ and /p/ were shifted rightwards by varying degrees, as well as leftwards, from the expected mean values of a typical L1 US English talker. With this manipulation of means they investigated how inclined listeners are to adapt their categorisation behaviors when the statistics of the exposure talker were shifted beyond the bounds of a typical talker.



- THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS WORK-
The study we report here builds on the pioneering work of @clayards2008perception and @kleinschmidt2016you with the aim to shed more light on how listeners interpretation of cues from a novel talker incrementally change as they receive more informative input of her cue-to-category mappings.

Specifically, while K&J16 demonstrated how prior beliefs of listeners can be inferred computationally from post-exposure categorisation, their experiment was not designed to capture listener categorisation data before exposure to a novel talker. Nor did they run intermittent tests to scrutinise the progress of adaptation. In the ideal adapter framework, listener expectations are predicted to be rationally updated through integration with the incoming speech input. In the computation of this process, each additional trial of exposure should cause listeners to move progressively closer to the target classification boundary implied by the exposure distribution. The overall design of the study was motivated by our aim to understand this incremental belief-updating process which has not been closely studied in previous work. We thus address the limitations of previous work and in conjunction, make use of ideal observer models to validate baseline assumptions that accompany this kind of speech perception study.

POINTS-TO-MAKE

  - Most of the work has focused on the outcome of exposure. 
  - Qualitatively, we know that exposing listeners to different distributions produces changes in categorisation behaviour towards the direction of the shifts. 
  - A stronger test for the computational framework is needed. 
  - The ideal adapter framework makes specific predictions about rational speech perception. For example, listeners' integrate the exposure with their prior knowledge and infer the cue-category distributions of a talker. Listeners hold implicit beliefs or expectations about the distributions of cues which they bring to an encounter. 
  - The strength of these beliefs has bearing on listener propensity to adapt to a new talker -- the stronger the prior beliefs the longer it takes to adapt. Listeners' strengths in prior beliefs about the means and variances are represented by parameters in the computational model. Listener behaviour observed collectively, thus far which speaks to this framework of thinking should by now be able to indicate roughly what those parameter values are. But it looks like those parameters are biased by the length of exposure and the outcome during experiments. No one has confronted this issue of very quick but limited adaptation which can't be solved by giving more exposure trials. 
  - How do we distinguish the results from normalization accounts which can also explain adaptation but is not usually regarded as learning?

-[IMPROVED ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY OF PARADIGM]
A secondary aim was to begin to address possible concerns of ecological validity of prior work. While no speech stimuli is ever ideal, previous work on which the current study is based did have limitations in one or two aspects:the artificiality of the stimuli or the artificiality of the distributions. For e.g. [@clayards2008perception] and [@kleinschmidt2016you] made use of synthesised stimuli that were robotic or did not sound human-like. The second way that those studies were limited was that the exposure distributions of the linguistic categories had identical variances [see also @theodore2019distributional] unlike what is found in production data where the variance of the voiceless categories are typically wider than that of the voiced category [@chodroff2017structure]. We take modest steps to begin to improve the ecological validity of this study while balancing the need for control through lab experiments by employing more natural sounding stimuli as well as by setting the variances of our exposure distributions to better reflect empirical data on production (see section x.xx. of SI).
