# Introduction
Human speech perception is a remarkable feat. Successful speech recognition requires that listeners map the acoustic signal onto words and meanings. But this signal-to-meaning mapping varies across talkers and context. The same word spoken by different talkers can sound quite different; and conversely, the same acoustic signal can imply different words depending on the talker. Yet, listeners typically recognize speech quickly and accurately across a wide range of talkers and acoustic conditions (after decades of advances, automatic speech recognition is just beginning to approach the recognition accuracy that most listeners display during everyday speech perception).

Research has identified *adaptivity* as a key component to the robustness of human speech perception. Although first encounters with an unfamiliar accent can cause initial processing difficulty, this difficulty diminishes with exposure, sometimes rapidly [e.g., @bradlow-bent2008; @bradlow2023; @sidaras2009; @xie2021jep]. Less than two dozen short sentences from an unfamiliar second language accent can significantly improve subsequent perception of that talker's speech [@clarke-garrett2004; @xie2018]. Under ideal conditions, large deviations from expected pronunciations along familiar phonetic dimensions can be detected after even shorter exposure [@cummings-theodore2023; @liu-jaeger2018], sometimes as few as a single trial [@kleinschmidt-jaeger2012; @vroomen2007]. Findings like these suggest that speech perception can be highly malleable, allowing listeners to quickly adjust the mapping from acoustics to phonetic categories and word meanings. While it had long been known that longer-term exposure can affect speech perception---we can, after all, learn new languages even as adults---the discovery of such rapid adaptation was a major breakthrough. It has been spurring the development of new paradigms and theories ever since [for reviews, see @bent-baeseberk2021; @cummings-theodore2023; @schertz-clare2020; @zheng-samuel2023]. 

What remains unclear is *how* such adaptation is achieved. How do listeners integrate information from a new talker, and how does this come to incrementally change their interpretation of that talker's speech? This is the question we seek to contribute to here. To fully appreciate our approach to this question, it is helpful to briefly reflect on the field. Research on adaptive speech perception tends to discuss informal---often descriptive, rather than explanatory---hypotheses [see also @norris-cutler2021]. This includes references to "boundary re-tuning/shift", "perceptual/phonetic recalibration/retuning", "category shift/expansion" or similar ideas [e.g., @mcqueen2006; @mitterer2013; @reinisch-holt2014; @schmale2012; @vroomen-baart2009; @xie2017; @zheng-samuel2020]. Such descriptions do not specify what mechanisms support adaptive speech perception, nor do they make predictions about how adaptation unfolds incrementally with each new observation from an unfamiliar talker. Our own past work is no exception to this trend.

Viewed from this perspective, research on adaptive speech perception can be an open-ended list of empirical questions. Is adaptation more or less immediate, or does it unfold gradually? If the latter, do changes in listeners' behavior accumulate additively, leading to more or less linear changes in behavior? If not a linear development, is adaptation first slow and then fast, or first fast and then slow? And, how do differences in listeners' prior experience affect how listeners adapt? Are there limits to listeners' ability to fully adapt to a new talker? Or can we adapt to more or less any accent provided sufficient input? Under a question- rather than theory-driven approach, each such question can be---and often is---viewed in separation. Attempts to integrate findings across studies have typically appealed to intuitions of the type described in the preceding paragraph---intuitions that can be misleading [see discussion of "category expansion" in @hitczenko-feldman2016; "boundary shift" in @kleinschmidt-jaeger2015]. Few attempts are made to integrate findings into a unifying theoretical model that is sufficiently predictive to detect informative incompatibility between the model and the data. But, as Allen Newell wrote already 50 years ago "you can't play 20 questions with nature and win" [@newell1973, p. 1]. 

Critically, there *are* theories that make clear, quantifiable predictions about all of the questions in the preceding paragraph---including basic predictions that remain untested. One of the most developed of these theories is the hypothesis that adaptive speech perception draws on *distributional learning* [e.g., @apfelbaum-mcmurray2015; @harmon2019; @johnson1997; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2015; @magnuson2020; @nearey-assmann2007; @sohoglu-davis2016]. Distributional learning models make untested predictions about how adaptation unfolds incrementally during the initial moments of listening to an unfamiliar talker. While distributional learning models differ from each other in important aspects, they share the central assumption that listeners incrementally learn and store information about talkers' speech. This includes information about the phonetic distributions that characterize the talker's speech, such as the average values of phonetic cues, their variability, or even the full phonetic distributions of all speech categories. These statistical properties are then used to interpret subsequent speech from the talker, supporting robust speech recognition across talkers [for reviews, see @schertz-clare2020; @xie2023]. 

<!-- TO DO: word smith -->
With these assumptions come shared predictions that we introduce next. Then we discuss why recent reviews of the field have rather unanimously concluded that we do *not* yet know to what extent distributional learning can explain rapid adaptation during speech perception [@bent-baeseberk2021; @coretta2023; @xie2023]. To anticipate the gist of that discussion, it is one thing to show that rapid changes in speech perception are qualitatively compatible with models of distributional learning---e.g., that prior experience can facilitates perception [e.g., @porrettaXXX] and even adaptation [@witteman2013], or that additional exposure in an experiment can improve subsequent speech perception [e.g., @escudero-williams2014; @REF-more]. It is a much different thing to test whether distributional learning can correctly predict the quantitative changes in speech perception that incrementally unfold across different types and amounts of exposure. The need for such stronger tests motivates the present study. Specifically, we aim to take a step towards the integrative, theory-driven vision outlined in @newell1973, "forcing enough detail and scope to tighten the inferential web that ties our experimental studies together" [p. 24]. This requires testing multiple predictions at the same time, and at more detail. As we show below, the 'stress tests' that theories are subjected to when tested against their ability *quantitatively* predict many conditions at the same time can help reveal previously unrecognized limits of existing models, and force new theory development [see also @yarkoni-westfall2017].

## Predictions
Consider a listener's initial encounter with an unfamiliar talker who produces some sounds, such as /d/ and /t/, in an unexpected way (Figure \@ref(fig:predictions)A). Listeners' perception is predicted to change incrementally with exposure to the talker's speech (Figure \@ref(fig:predictions)B-C). Distributional learning models make four predictions about how these changes unfold incrementally. First, the direction and magnitude of that change should gradiently depend on listeners' prior expectations based on relevant previously experienced speech input from other talkers (**prediction 1 - *prior expectations***), and both the amount (**prediction 2a - *exposure amount***) and distribution of phonetic cues in the exposure input from the unfamiliar talker [**prediction 2b - *exposure distribution* **, for review, see @xie2023]. Specifically, listeners' categorization functions---the mapping from acoustics to phonetic categories and words---should gradually shift from a starting point that reflects the statistics of previously experienced speech towards a target that reflects the statistics of the new talker's speech. Standard distributional learning models further predict that this shift proceeds until the listener has fully learned the statistics of the new talker's speech (**prediction 3 - *learn to convergence***), though alternative models exist [e.g., adaptive speech perception as selection or reweighting between already learned representations, @kleinschmidt-jaeger2015, part II]. Finally, some distributional learning models further commit to specific learning mechanisms that constrain how exactly adaptation is expected to accumulate incrementally: both error-driven theories [@harmon2019; @olejarczuk2018; @sohoglu-davis2016] and theories of ideal information integration [@kleinschmidt-jaeger2015; @kleinschmidt2020] predict that adaptation initially proceeds quickly and then slows down as the listener approaches the correct mapping from the acoustic signal to phonetic categories (**prediction 4 - *diminishing returns***).^[Predictions (1)-(4) assume that listeners *know* that they are listening to the same new talker. Talker recognition is itself an active inference process that we do not further discuss here [but see @kleinschmidt-jaeger2015; @magnuson-nusbaum2007].] Such diminishing returns have been demonstrated for many learning phenomena [@rescorla-wagnerXXXX; @REF-more]. But it is an open question whether rapid changes in speech perception reflect such learning processes---a hypothesis that some have called into question given the timecourse of such changes [@xie2018].

Figure \@ref(fig:predictions)D illustrates predictions 3 and 4 and contrasts them with other possible scenarios, such as immediate talker switching; linear, rather than sublinear, changes to the point of convergence; or convergence against partial adaptation. These scenarios are not meant as an exhaustive list, but rather to illustrate that there are many possible ways that adaptive speech perception might unfold---some more plausible than others. 'Premature convergence' against partial adaptation, for example, could result from strong constraints on distributional learning, as expected if the early moments of adaptation are limited to the reweighting of previously learned dialect or sociolect representations [see discussion in @wade2022; @xie2018]. 

(ref:predictions) Some hypothetical ways in which adaptive changes in listeners perception might unfold incrementally, using the pronunciation of US English word-initial /d/ and /t/ as an example (as in "dip" vs. "tip"). **Panel A:** Transparent lines indicate cross-talker variability in the realization of /d/ and /t/ along the primary cue used to distinguish them (voice onset timing or VOT). Shown are 20 random talkers from a database of connected speech [@chodroff-wilson2018]. The thicker solid lines indicate a 'typical' talker (averaging over all talkers in the database). Dashed lines indicate a hypothetical unfamiliar talker with a noticeably different distribution of VOT values. **Panel B:** Ideal categorization functions along the phonetic VOT continuum for speech from a typical talker (*idealized pre-exposure listener*, SI \@ref(sec:idealized-prior-listeners)) and speech from the unfamiliar talker (*idealized learner* that has fully learned that talkers distributions, SI \@ref(sec:idealized-learners)). Grey arrows point to the points of subjective equality (PSE), the point along the phonetic VOT continuum at which listeners are equally likely to identify a sound as an instance of /d/ or /t/. **Panel C:** The same as in Panel B but just showing the PSE. **Panel D:** Different ways in which listeners' PSEs along the phonetic VOT continuum might incrementally change with increasing exposure to the unfamiliar talker (from more transparent to less transparent). The horizontal lines indicates the ideal PSEs from Panel C.

## What is known about distributional learning as mechanism for rapid adaptive speech perception?
Several recent reviews echo the need for experimental paradigms and analysis approaches that can more strongly constrain theories of adaptive speech perception [@bent-baeseberk2021; @coretta2023; @schertz-clare2020; @xie2023]. Based on detailed computational simulations, Xie and colleagues argue that such strong tests require (a) information about the distribution of phonetic cues in both listeners' prior experience and during exposure, (b) paradigms that measure incremental changes in listeners' behavior both within and across exposure conditions, and, critically, (c) analyses that quantitatively link the latter to the former---ideally, while comparing those changes in listeners' behavior to quantitative predictions of distributional learning models. 

<!-- TO DO: think about where references proposed by reviewers should be added in the paras below -->
Very few existing studies meet these standards. For example, there is now substantial evidence that increased prior experience with a particular L2-accent can facilitate more accurate understanding, as well as faster adaptation, to unfamiliar talkers of that accent [@REF-porretta; @witteman2013]. Findings like these demonstrate clear effects of prior experience on speech perception, in line with prediction 1 of distributional learning theories. These findings leave open, however, whether the specific benefits of prior experiences are predicted by the *distributions of phonetic cues* that listeners have previously experienced [see discussion in @tan-jaeger2021]. 

Similar limitations apply to recent findings that repeated exposure to identical or phonetically highly similar stimuli can result in a gradient, cumulative build-up of changes in listeners perception [e.g., @cummings-theodore2023; @liu-jaeger2018; @poellman2011; @vroomen2007; @REF-more]. These studies are qualitatively with prediction 2a. However, none of these studies analyzed the phonetic distributions listeners were exposed to. Among other things, this raises questions about the ecological validity of the exposure inputs, and the extent to which such exposure regimes can be informative about everyday adaptive speech perception. Perhaps more importantly, however, it means that such studies leave open whether the observed changes are due to distributional learning rather than, for example, changes in decision biases [@REF]. In fact, it leaves open a much more basic question---whether distributional learning would correctly predict the observed incremental build-up of changes in listeners' perception. For example, several of these studies observed that adaptation only accumulated up to a certain number of exposure stimuli, after which no further changes were observed [@cummings-theodore2023; @liu-jaeger2018]. Some studies even found that adaptation seemed to reverse after extended exposure [@vroomen2007; @REF-more]. Do these findings follow from the statistics of the stimuli, or do they point to deeper constraints on adaptive speech perception [see discussion in @kleinschmidt-jaeger2015]? To answer questions like these, it is necessary to compare the incremental changes in listeners' perception against quantitative predictions of distributional learning models.

The line of research that has perhaps provided the strongest tests of distributional learning theories has typically directly manipulated the phonetic distributions during exposure [@idemaru-holt2011; @idemaru-holt2020; @zhang-holt2018; @REF-more]. Some studies have even applied distributional learning models to the exposure inputs of those experiments, and compared the predictions of these models to listeners' behavior [@clayards2008; @kleinschmidt2015; @harmon2019; @REF-more]. These paradigms come particularly close to the standard described by @xie2023, and the form the inspiration for the present work. Our approach is .... We seek to build on these previous distributional learning works in a number of ways ...  [incremental/earlier; increased validity of sims and distributions]

Those that do have typically focused on longer-term exposure, investigation changes in perception following hundreds of exposure trials [@REF], sometimes spanning multiple days [@REF]. 





it is time to go beyond separate, typically qualitative, tests of these predictions: simply put, it is one thing to show that rapid changes in speech perception have qualitative properties that are broadly compatible with models of distributional learning---e.g., that exposure improves the accuracy of speech perception. There is now a wealth of such evidence. But it is a rather different thing to test whether distributional learning can quantitatively predict incremental changes in speech perception across different types and amounts of exposure.


We submit distributional learning theories of adaptive speech perception to a stronger test by incrementally assessing several of its core predictions simultaneously and quantitatively. This includes predictions for which qualitative support exists across separate studies, and predictions that have remained untested so far. Our goal in doing so is to assess just *how well* this framework captures rapid incremental changes in listeners' perception as a function of exposure, and to identify aspects of the data that can*not* (yet) be explained by the distributional learning. Simply put, it is one thing to show that rapid changes in speech perception have qualitative properties that are broadly compatible with models of distributional learning---e.g., that exposure improves the accuracy of speech perception. There is now a wealth of such evidence (to which we return below). But it is a rather different thing to test whether distributional learning can actually consistently explain incremental changes in speech perception across different types and amounts of exposure. Indeed, as we find in the present study, putting theories to such stress tests can help identify their limitations, and/or need for further theory development. 

We combine (i) an incremental exposure-test distributional learning paradigm with (ii) a novel analysis approach---incremental Bayesian mixed-effects psychometric models---and (iii) model-guided interpretation. Unlike most previous work, our incremental paradigm focuses on the rapid changes during the early moments of exposure to an unfamiliar talker, while carefully manipulating the *distributions* of speech cues. This allows us to obtain substantially more fine-grained data about the early effects of distributional exposure than in previous paradigms, which either focused on longer distributional exposure [an order of magnitude more trials than the earliest test in our study, @chladkova2017; @clayards2008; @colby2018; @escudero2011; @goudbeek2008; @logan1991] or focused on early effects but did not analyze how these effects arose from the phonetic distributions experienced during exposure [e.g., @cummings-theodore2023; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2012; @kraljic-samuel2007; @poellmann2011; @vroomen2007]. The mixed-effects psychometric model we present provide a theory-agnostic way to quantify the incremental changes in listeners' categorization function---the mapping from phonetic cues to speech categories. This goes beyond qualitative changes in the proportion of listeners' answers [e.g., @escudero2011; @escudero-williams2014; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2012; @vroomen2007], thereby facilitating stronger tests of distributional learning. Finally, model-guided interpretation through comparison to ideal observer and ideal adaptor models helps us determine whether listeners behavior before, during, and following exposure follows the predictions of distributional learning. It also is this use of model-guided interpretation that allows us to identify *unexpected* constraints on distributional learning---constraints that can be shown to *not* follow from state-of-the-art models. Such unexpected limitations are more informative for theory development than findings that are 'merely' counter-intuitive.^[For instance, seemingly surprising failures to find adaptation for some speech stimuli [@floccia2006; @zheng-samuel2020] can be compatible with distributional learning [@tan2021], and the same has been argued for some seemingly arbitrary properties of adaptive speech perception [e.g., the 'undoing' of adaptation after prolonged exposure to the exact same stimulus, @vroomen2007; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2012].]




Although predictions (1)-(4) are specific and testable, they remain largely untested. This is in part due to limitations of the designs and paradigms used in research on adaptive speech perception. The most common paradigms expose one group of listeners to one speech pattern (e.g., rightward shifted VOT distributions as in Figure \@ref(fig:predictions)A), and a second group of listeners to another speech pattern (e.g., leftward shifted VOT distributions). Following exposure, both groups are tested on their ability to recognize one of the two speech patterns. Such designs were effective in establishing the *existence* of adaptive speech perception [see also @cummings-theodore2023]. They do, however, offer only weak tests of existing theories [for demonstration, see @xie2023]. Put simply, it is one thing to show that differences in exposure lead to differences in behavior; it is another thing to test whether the direction and magnitude of changes in behavior can be consistently explained by existing theories (given the distribution of phonetic properties during exposure). 

Recent reviews have thus called for the development of paradigms that can more strongly constrain theories of adaptive speech perception [@bent-baeseberk2021; @coretta2023; @schertz-clare2020; @xie2023]. Based on computational simulations, Xie and colleagues argue that strong tests require (a) information about the distribution of phonetic cues in both listeners' prior experience and during exposure, (b) paradigms that measure incremental changes in listeners' behavior both within and across exposure conditions, and (c) analyses that link the latter to the former. <!-- TO DO ... need to spell out idea of quantitative models and strong normative baselines HERE. be clear that this remains rare and has never been applied to incremental analyses. Yet several recent reviews of the field ask for exactly this type of analysis (normative: norris-cutler; strong predictive: yarkoni-westfall; guest-martin; xie2023) --> The present study responds to this call. We present a novel incremental exposure-test paradigm, and use it to test predictions (1)-(4), repeated in Table \@ref(tab:predictions). 

```{r block-design-figure, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.cap="Incremental exposure-test design of our experiment. The three *between-participant* exposure conditions (rows) differed in the distribution of voice onset time (VOT), the primary phonetic cue to syllable-initial /d/ and /t/ in English (e.g., \"dip\" vs. \"tip\"). Test blocks assessed L1-US English listeners' categorization functions over VOT stimuli that were held identical within and across conditions.", fig.pos="H"}

```

Figure \@ref(fig:block-design-figure) illustrates our approach. Between groups of participants, we manipulate the distance between the distributions of phonetic cues in the exposure input. The total number of tokens that make up entire distributions within each group were evenly distributed between the exposure blocks (48 per block). This set up can be thought of as the exposure distribution being fully revealed by the end of exposure block 3 (see \@ref(fig:design-distribution) for more details). <!-- We focus on a phonetic contrast that is known to be subject to adaptive changes in perception [syllable-initial /d/-/t/ in US English, @kleinschmidt2015; @kraljic-samuel2006]. --> The three exposure distributions we use are shifted to different degrees both relative to each other, and relative to listeners' prior expectations. <!-- This sentence will change depending on how we agree to name the conditions. If we treat +10 as condition 0 then baseline would be named -10 and +40 would be named +30--> This allows us to test predictions 1 and 2a,b that direction and magnitude of that change should gradiently depend on how and how much the current talker's speech deviates from the listeners’ prior expectations. We measure listeners' categorization functions at multiple points during exposure, and determine whether the direction and magnitude of the observed changes in behavior are consistent with the predictions of distributional learning models, including prediction 4 about the diminishing rate of changes in listeners' behavior. To further guide the interpretation of results, we use normative models of adaptive speech perception [ideal observers and adaptors, @feldman2009; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2015; @massaro1989; @xie2023]. This enables predictions about---intentionally idealized---listeners and distributional learners, prior to considerations about memory or other cognitive limitations. Comparisons of participants' categorization functions against these normative models provides a principled and informative approach to identifying constraints on adaptive speech perception, addressing prediction 3 about learning to convergence.

Our paradigm integrates, and builds on, advances in separate lines of research on unsupervised distributional learning during speech perception [@clayards2008; @colby2018; @kleinschmidt2020; @theodore-monto2019], lexically- or visually-guided perceptual learning [LGPL/VGPL, @cummings-theodore2023; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2012; @vroomen2007], and adaptation to natural accents [@hitczenko-feldman2016; @tan2021; @xie2021cognition]. We return to these and related works in the general discussion. For readers unfamiliar with this literature, we briefly make two observations that motivate the paradigm in Figure \@ref(fig:block-design-figure).

First, as indicated in Table \@ref(tab:predictions), previous research has focused on the *outcome* of learning, leaving open whether adaptive speech perception unfolds over time in ways consistent with distributional learning models. For example, in an important early study, @clayards2008 exposed two different groups of US English listeners to instances of "b" and "p" that differed in their distribution along the voice onset time continuum (VOT). VOT is the primary phonetic cue to word-initial stops in US English: the voiced category (e.g., /b/, /d/, or /g/) is produced with lower VOT than the voiceless category (/p/, /t/, /k/). Clayards and colleagues held the VOT means of /b/ and /p/ constant between the two exposure groups, but manipulated whether both /b/ and /p/ had wide or narrow variance along VOT. Using a distributional learning model similar to the idealized learners we presented below, Clayards and colleagues predicted that listeners in the wide variance group would exhibit a more shallow categorization function than the narrow variance group. This is precisely what they found, providing support for prediction 2b that the distribution of phonetic cues in the exposure input causes changes in listeners' behavior [see also @nixon2016; @theodore-monto2019]. Findings like these suggests that the outcome of adaptation is qualitatively compatible with predictions (2a) and (2b) of distributional learning models [see also @hitczenko-feldman2016; @tan2021; @xie2021cognition].^[A related line of work has used distributional learning or explicit training paradigms to study the acquisition of *novel* sound contrasts [e.g., @maye2002; @mcclelland1999; @pajak-levy2012; @pisoni1982]. These studies, too, have observed outcomes predicted by distributional learning models [for review, see @pajak2016].] 

These findings are, however, based on tests that averaged over, and/or followed, hundreds of exposure trials---exposure amounts that exceed what is available during many everyday interactions with unfamiliar talkers. This leaves open then whether the learning mechanism identified in distributional learning studies are sufficiently rapid to have a meaningful impact on those interactions. <!-- TO DO after submission--- (1) could consider returning to these works in the general discussion, highlighting the link to L1 constraints on L2 learning; (2) could add this back in: Here, we focus on adaptation to shifts along *known* phonetic continua---i.e., the type of input that is generally believed to be easiest to adapt to. --> The strong focus on the outcome of adaptation also means that we do not know how listeners incrementally interpolate between their prior expectations and new phonetic input (the joint effects of predictions 1 and 2a,b). And it explains why predictions (3 - *learn to convergence*) and (4 - *diminishing returns*) have remained untested: tests of these two predictions require a repeated exposure-test paradigm like the one we present here [for discussion, see @cummings-theodore2023; @kleinschmidt2020].

Second, there often is a tension between ecological validity and the ability to make strong, quantitative predictions (though recent advances in automatic speech recognition and large language models might ultimately help resolve this tension). For these reasons, it has remained challenging to test distributional learning models against fully natural speech. This makes it difficult to test, on such stimuli, predictions (1) and (2b) about the effects of phonetic distributions listeners experience throughout their lifetime and during the experiment. Even recent tests against exposure to fully natural speech have thus focused on broad qualitative comparisons [e.g., @schertz2016; @xie2017; see also, @schertz-clare2020]. This leaves open whether the direction and magnitude of changes in listeners' behavior can be explained by existing models [but see @hitczenko-feldman2016; @tan2021; @xie2021cognition]. 

Tests of distributional learning models have thus largely relied on paradigms that afford researchers with fine-grained control over the distribution of phonetic properties that listeners experience in the experiment [e.g., @chladkova2017; @clayards2008; @colby2018; @idemaru-holt2011; @kleinschmidt2020; @theodore-monto2019]. As we aim to demonstrate below, such control is necessary for stronger tests of existing theories, but it often comes with sacrifices in ecological validity (for now, at least). We follow this approach here. As detailed under *Methods*, we do, however, take several modest steps towards addressing concerns about ecological validity. This includes concerns about both the stimuli and their distribution in the experiment [see discussion in @baeseberk2018]. 

To anticipate our results, we find that the changes in listeners' categorization behavior *largely* follow the predictions of distributional learning models. In particular, we present the first direct evidence that the direction and magnitude of changes in listeners' categorization functions is jointly determined by their prior expectations (prediction 1) and the amount and distribution of phonetic cues in the exposure input (predictions 2a,b). We also find initial---though not decisive---evidence that changes in rate of adaptation throughout exposure are consistent with the predictions of error-driven learning theories and theories of ideal information integration (prediction 4). We show that a Bayesian model of adaptation that is based on principles of ideal information integration [the ideal adaptor, @kleinschmidt-jaeger2015; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2016] predicts participants' responses with very high accuracy ($R^2 = 97\%$). However, not all observations we make are predicted by existing models, providing new insights into previously unrecognized limits of adaptation. In particular, we find little support for prediction 3 (*learn to convergence*). Rather, changes in listeners' behavior seem to plateau long before listeners achieve the categorization functions and accuracy that would be expected if they fully learned the talkers' phonetic distributions (cf. the *premature convergence* panel of Figure \@ref(fig:predictions)D). We also find that this constraint on adaptation seems to be asymmetric, depending on the direction of the shift in the exposure input relative to listeners' prior expectations. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of adaptive speech perception, and suggest how future variants of our paradigm can be used to further contrast different models of adaptive speech perception.

This study was not publicly pre-registered. The design, participant recruitment, and procedure were internally pre-registered as part of an undergraduate class at the University of Rochester (BCS206/207). The experiment was originally designed to address predictions 1-3. Our analyses of prediction (4 - *diminishing returns*) are thus post-hoc, as are some of the analyses we present to understand the evidence against prediction 3 (*learn to convergence*). All post-hoc analyses are indicated as such. Finally, the ideal observer and adaptor models introduced below to guide interpretation of results follow our previous work ### **ommitted for review** ###<!-- [@kleinschmidt-jaeger2015; @tan2021; @xie2023]-->. However, the choice of phonetic data on which these models are trained constitute researcher degrees of freedom. Where relevant, we motivate our decisions.
