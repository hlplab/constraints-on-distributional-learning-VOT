# TO-DO

## Highest priority
 * MARYANN
  * Figure out why slopes aren't identical across conditions under our current way of averaging exposure across all participants.
  * fit nested model: Condition / (block*VOT). Sample prior = "yes". This is to make the argument of block-to-block change within each condition. 
    * make a hypothesis table that summarises the main effect of block for each exposure condition

  * Try an add line to table 2 to separate the unlearning hypothesis from the others (low priority). Add +40 vs baseline sub-heading
  
  There's a discussion of how priors affect our results-- could it be that we would have found convergence if we hadn't been so conservative? 
  Due to a mistake early on we still found the general result pattern. There's of course the discussion that we did use uniform priors.
  

## Medium priority

 * MARYANN
  * Fix a lot of the outstanding XXXes. Fill in the references -- in library.bib

  
 * FLORIAN
  * think about table 1 and 2: how to change the wording on tables to actually refer to intercepts rather than PSEs or change the figures? Changing current representations of analyses to improve intuitive-ity. 
  * write overview of results
  * restructure results presentation.
  * write SI sections with proofs
  
### Lower Priority

 * MARYANN
  * Combine data from exposure and test, use all together instead of coding block, code trial and code it as a smooth. That means using GAMM -- that may require taking lapse (try it first without lapses because the GAMM takes care of the lapse. The RE will be expressed differently. It has to follow the GAMM syntax.) The primary thing we want to smooth over is "block", but could theoretically smooth over VOT and Block.

    
 * Florian
  * compare IBBU predictions over blocks with human behavioural data

## To do later
  
  * Everyone: Eat ice-cream and perhaps have a beer.
