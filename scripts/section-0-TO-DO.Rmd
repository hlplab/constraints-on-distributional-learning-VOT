# TO-DO

 + Get back to concept of informative incompatibility

 + restructure overview of our goals:
    + focus on rapid adaptation rather than long-terms learning, anticipating that those might be subject to other constraints.
    + submit DL to stronger, quantitative test, advancing the standard of analysis in our field. While this might in many cases yield confirmations of what we believe to be known, it also has to potential to discover unexpected findings. We'll only know once we take this route.
    + increase ecological validity in order to increase probability of generalization to everyday speech perception
 + highlight intent to move towards stronger test of the idea we adapt to distribution, while taking substantial steps towards more ecologically valid inputs
    + natural sounding speech
    + natural correlations between cues
    + natural asymmetry in variances 
    + sampled, natural distributions, rather than symmetric
    + large number of unique locations and thus phonetic inputs, combine with different lexical context
    + mix of unlabeled and labeled, plus zero explicit supervision/feedback

# Keeping some text around
Stronger tests and models are needed to address this latter question: paradigms and analyses that go beyond dichotomous comparisons, instead measuring changes in listeners' perception as they incrementally unfold with different amounts and types of distributional exposure.
