# TO-DO

## Highest priority
 * MARYANN
  * rename conditions to have consistent names across data files and ios. e.g., always baseline, shift10, shift40, or always Shift0, Shift10, Shift40 (pay attention to casing!). Currently, it is a MESS.
  * KJ16 plot: fix legends, fix y-axis to conform to current convention, add 0 reference line *typical talker + IO references lines (predicted PSEs)
  * main plot:
    * remove vertical gridlines
    * reference dashed lines: put labels for e.g. "+21.x ms (100%)" on the right edge.
    * change point estimate to a label with "+/-XX.X%" (rounded to 1 digit). data frame must have all info necessary to calculate data for that label geom.
  * fit nested model: Condition / (block*VOT). Sample prior = "yes". This is to make the argument of block-to-block change within each condition. 
    * make a hypothesis table that summarises the main effect of block for each exposure condition
  * Non-parametric density plot. 
    * Apply correction for vowel duration!
  * Try an add line to table 2 to separate the unlearning hypothesis from the others (low priority). Add +40 vs baseline sub-heading

## Medium priority

 * MARYANN
  * KJ16 plot: include point ranges in PSE comparison plot
  * Fix a lot of the outstanding XXXes. Fill in the references -- in library.bib
  * Heterogenous normal distribution
  * fix appearance of annotations in histogram plot
  
 * FLORIAN
  * think about table 1 and 2: how to change the wording on tables to actually refer to intercepts rather than PSEs or change the figures? Changing current representations of analyses to improve intuitive-ity. 
  * write overview of results
  * restructure results presentation.
  * write SI sections with proofs
  
### Lower Priority

 * MARYANN
  * standardize "ms" vs. "msec"
  * Decide on PSE vs. category boundary 
  * standardize BE vs. AE spelling (categoriz/sation, label(l)ed, synthesiz/sed etc.)
   * Figure 2: A small figure to anticipate the type of format in the main figure. Exposure is x-axis (less to more exposure). Under one prediciton you keep growing 00 prediction o BBU model. The other one is plataeuing and converging against something. 
    
 * Florian
  * compare IBBU predictions over blocks with human behavioural data

## To do later
  
  * Everyone: Eat ice-cream and perhaps have a beer.
