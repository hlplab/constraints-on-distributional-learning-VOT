# TO-DO

## Highest priority
 * FLORIAN: edits
   * Introduction: 
     * as a case in point, anticipate that we identify some previously unrecognized or at least under-appreciated properties of adaptive speech perception. This leads us to conduct some exploratory analyses that point towards interesting direction for future work. 



 * MARYANN:
  * Make two figure that summaries the human and model accuracies. The figures will parallel Figure 4C and Figure 6. Specifically:
    * For the Figure to parallel Figure 4C: **This figure will quantify whether listeners had already converged against maximum accuracy, which is relevant for the GD.** 
      * Get accuracies of human responses on *un*labelled trials for each exposure & block combination. There are two different measures: i) the accuracy of the actual responses and ii) the *expected* accuracy given the psychometric model. I suggest we calculate both. i) can be calculated only for the unlabeled exposure trials. ii) can be calculated for both exposure and test blocks (each time applying the psychometric function from that block-condition combination to the 72 unlabeled exposure tokens of the condition). I would probably plot the expected accuracies as CI as you do for the PSEs in Figure 4C. and I might indicate the actual accuracies as triangle point estimate on top of that.
      * Compare  to the expected accuracies under ideal pre-exposure listener (IO) and idealized learner (IO). wW only want to evaluate each of them against the exposure condition it was actually trained on. 
      * Make separate version of this Figure --- one based on criterion choice rule, and one based on Luce. The latter will likely go into the main text, potentially somewhere in the result section if you agree that it's informative. 
    * For the figure to parallel Figure 6: This figure will compare human (expected) accuracies against the expected accuracies for an ideal learner (IA). This figure is probably less important than the one described above.
  * Get BFs for the difference in the degree of adaptation ('shrinkage'). Simply do hypothesis test for intercept (or PSE, same as rest of paper) using the psychometric model with simple effects for condition. Use the simple effects during test 4 and test hypothesis that (idealized learner-predicted intercept - simple effect of condition) > or < than the same for another condition. **These BFs quantify whether degree of shrinkage differs between conditions**
  * Ccalculate the shrinkage (in Test 4) *predicted* by the IA. In Figure 6, it looks a bit like the IA does, after all, predict the shrinkage pattern. I don't yet see why that would be the case. But let's start by calculating the percentage adaptation that the *IA* has achieved in Test 4 for each of the three exposure conditions (i.e., the shaded intervals in Figure 6).
  * Consider using IA fit with mu & Sigma set to mean(mu) and Sigma derived by taking geometric mean of tau (vector of SDs) and mean of omega (correlation matrix) across five folds. If such a model with just 3 DFs also predicts that data relatively well, we should probably use that simpler model for this paper. That will also pre-empt questions about what the mu and Sigma priors were that the IA model inferred.  
  **To validate the IA as a decently ok model**, compare IA vs. pyschometric model in terms of: 
     * R2
     * LOOIC
     * Add these measures to Section on "Constraints on (the early moments of) adaptive speech perception?" (see inline comments in R markdown)
  * Get BFs comparing IA-predicted intercept and psychometric-predicted intercept for each test block. **These BFs quantify whether IA model indeed over/under-predicts.**
 
## High priority
 * Integrate other distributional learning work. K20 mentions Chládková et al., 2017; Colby et al., 2018; Theodore et al., 2015. Are those studies we should at least cite? What do they find? What about additional work by Volya that Maryann mentioned? Other work by Meghan Clayards?
 * Change order of possible explanations, starting with theoretically most relevant.
 * Replot Dave's incremental adaptation figure (figure 9) in GD (search for "Figure 9).
 * Consider replotting shrinkage figure (but with our aesthetics). this could be the figure that you at some point had added to the introduction, showing individual participants categorization functions, the idealized pre-exposure listeners, and the idealized learner in one panel, and in the other panel the violin shrinkage plot.
 * add tick marks for TEST tokens to Figure 3 (caption already adjusted)
  


## Medium priority

 * MARYANN
  * Continue to fill in blanks (refs, bibs)
  * Check captions carefully and update.
  * Remove libraries from preamble that are just meant for debugging and version tracking (latexdiffr)


### Lower Priority
  * 

## To do later
  
  * Everyone: Eat ice-cream and perhaps have a beer.
