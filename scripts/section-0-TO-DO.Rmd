TO-DO

## Highest priority
 * MARYANN
  * KJ16 plot: fix legends, fix y-axis to conform to current convention, add 0 reference line *typical talker + IO references lines (predicted PSEs) ,medium priority: include point rqanges in PSE comparison plot
  * main plot:
    *remove vertical gridlines
    *reference dashed lines: put labels for e.g. +21.x ms (100%) on the right edge.
    * change point estimate to a label with +x% : data frame must have all info necessary to calculate data for that label geom. % in the label must have +/-, rounded to 1 digit
    
  * fit nested model: Condition/ (block*VOT). Sample prior = "yes". This is to make the argument of block-to-block change within each condition. 
  * make a hypothesis table that summarises the main effect of block for each exposure condition
  * take only top part of non-parametric density plot. Change caption
  * Try an add line to table 2 to separate the unlearning hypothesis from the others (low priority). Add +40 vs baseline sub-heading
    
    

## Medium priority

* MARYANN

  *Fix a lot of the outstanding XXXes. Fill in the references -- in library.bib
  * Heterogenous normal distribution
  * fix appearance of annotations in histogram file
  
  â€¢ Florian
    *think about table 1 and 2: how to change the wording on tables to actually refer to intercepts rather than PSEs or change the figures? Changing current representations of analyses to improve intuitive-ity. 
    * write overview of results
    * restructure results presentation.
    * write SI sections with proofs
  
### Lower Priority

* MARYANN

  * Decide on PSE vs. category boundary 
  * standardize BE vs. AE spelling (categoriz/sation, label(l)ed, synthesiz/sed etc.)
   * Figure 2: A small figure to anticipate the type of format in the main figure. Exposure is x-axis (less to more exposure). Under one prediciton you keep growing 00 prediction o BBU model. The other one is plataeuing and converging against something. 
    
  * Florian
      * compare IBBU predictions over blocks with human behavioural data


## To do later
  
  * Everyone: Eat ice-cream and perhaps have a beer.
