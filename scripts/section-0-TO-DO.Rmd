# TO-DO

## Highest priority
 * MARYANN
  * Fill in missing references

## Medium priority

 * MARYANN
  

  
 * FLORIAN
  * think about table 1 and 2: how to change the wording on tables to actually refer to intercepts rather than PSEs or change the figures? Changing current representations of analyses to improve intuitive-ity. 
  * write overview of results
  * restructure results presentation.
  * write SI sections with proofs
  
### Lower Priority

 * MARYANN
  * Combine data from exposure and test, use all together instead of coding block, code trial and code it as a smooth. That means using GAMM -- that may require taking lapse (try it first without lapses because the GAMM takes care of the lapse. The RE will be expressed differently. It has to follow the GAMM syntax.) The primary thing we want to smooth over is "block", but could theoretically smooth over VOT and Block.

    
 * Florian
  * compare IBBU predictions over blocks with human behavioural data

## To do later
  
  * Everyone: Eat ice-cream and perhaps have a beer.
