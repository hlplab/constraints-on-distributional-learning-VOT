# TO-DO

 + Get back to concept of informative incompatibility
 + Get back to number of combinations of tests (128 data points vs binary contrast)


 + highlight intent to move towards stronger test of the idea we adapt to distribution, while taking substantial steps towards more ecologically valid inputs
    + natural sounding speech
    + natural correlations between cues
    + natural asymmetry in variances 
    + sampled, natural distributions, rather than symmetric
    + large number of unique locations and thus phonetic inputs, combine with different lexical context
    + mix of unlabeled and labeled, plus zero explicit supervision/feedback

# Keeping some text around
Stronger tests and models are needed to address this latter question: paradigms and analyses that go beyond dichotomous comparisons, instead measuring changes in listeners' perception as they incrementally unfold with different amounts and types of distributional exposure.
