# TO-DO

## Highest priority
 * FLORIAN: edits
   * Introduction: 
     * clarify what we mean by "stronger tests": e.g., absence/presence vs. relative direction and order of effects vs. specific magnitudes (not yet the goal). 
     * as a case in point, anticipate that we identify some previously unrecognized or at least under-appreciated properties of adaptive speech perception. This leads us to conduct some exploratory analyses that point towards interesting direction for future work. 
     
   * Results or discussion:
     * By comparing these changes to predictions about listeners' prior behavior based on the statistics of previously experienced input, it becomes possible to understand WHY these changes occur.
     * By comparing the limits of these changes to predictions about idealised learners, it becomes possible to detect limitations in adaptation that would otherwise go unnnoticed. Here, too, doing so incrementally further yields adding insights (IBBU model)
     
   * General discussion:
     * add section on analysis/methods: a single psychometric model. still can be improved. point to extensions in the SI.
     * either here or as footnote in methods: be clear that other approaches also make assumptions: e.g, logistic regression or anova etc. assume 0 lapse rates. separate tests at different VOT steps weaken power and fail to recognize that the tests are not independent of each other. This approach --- as well as approaches that aggregate over VOT steps--- also fail to include constraints in the analysis that any reasonable theory of adaptive speech perception should arguably include (such that effects of VOT are monotonic --- at least between the two category means).


 * MARYANN
 
## High priority
  * Extract posterior predictions from IBBU fit. Plot the predicted PSE and credible interval by block and category
  * Logistic regression over the IA predictions (analogous to the logistic regression of the IO predictions)
  * Make a copy of main figure and place it in the SI; remove panel C from the main figure
  * Check on how Eleanor Chodroff annotated her corpus data with sonorants as codas -- make note

## Medium priority

 * MARYANN
  * Continue to fill in blanks (refs, bibs)
  * Check captions carefully and update.
  * Remove libraries from preamble that are just meant for debugging and version tracking (latexdiffr)


### Lower Priority
  * look into streamlining functions: get_logistic_parameters_from_model and get_logistic_parameters_from_IBBU

## To do later
  
  * Everyone: Eat ice-cream and perhaps have a beer.
