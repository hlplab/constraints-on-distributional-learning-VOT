# TO-DO

## Highest priority
 * MARYANN
  * CHECK THE PREPVARS FUNCTION TO INCLUDE DIFF. CODING FOR ALL PHASES -- 1) DIFF CODING FOR TEST ONLY 2)DIFF CODING FOR EXPOSURE ONLY AND 3)DIFF CODING FOR ALL PHASES
  * REFIT THE EXPOSURE MODEL UNDER THE CORRECT DIFF CODING if it wasn't coded that way before
  * edit Analaysis Approach section in the SI
  * write function to represent BF = Inf to be >[number of posterior draws/samples]
  * have simple effects of block table
  * move interaction table to SI
  * Please read this carefully.
  * TIME TO STOP MESSY CODING. Let's have a zero-tolerance policy for that from now on in the main working branch (i.e., you can do what you'd like in branches that aren't the main branch, but you canNOT merge without cleaning up first). It is a real time-sink for everyone else and makes it near impossible for me to effectively help. 
     * on the main working branch, functions should be in functions.R, in a clearly named section (see existing examples).
  * Input data file:
    * There shouldn't be multiple data files that you're loading. E.g., I don't understand why there is an exposure trials data file in addition to the main data file. It's just confusing. Let's not do things like that.
    * Have a script in your other repo (for your thesis) that does all the data importing, variable and value formatting, etc. The input data file experiment-results.csv should already contain all the information you (and others might need) and be in the format that you'd like it to be. That's the only data file that will be in your paper repo. 
      * Think carefully about how to name variables consistently and create all variants of variables you might need in the paper, e.g., Response, Item.ExpectedResponse, Response.Category, Item.ExpectedResponse.Category, Response.Voiced, Item.ExpectedResponse.Voiced (etc. if you indeed need all of those; we definitely need the first two pairs of these).
      * Also if you have to consistently rename levels for plotting, please just changed them once in the script that creates the file. E.g., there's various places in which you deal with formatting the conditions and various names floating around (Shift0, 10, etc.; +0, +10, etc.; baseline, + 10 etc.). Pick one, do it at the top of the pipeline (i.e., in the input script). This will reduce the potential for error in your own coding, make your code in the main paper shorter, and it'll be much easier to read for others trying to follow your code (including me).
      * Remove all data formatting code from the paper Rmd. There should only be a single load line.
      * I've moved the code loading the chodroff data into the new pre-amble.R file. Consider doing the same for the experiment data. That way the data that we need throughout are available throughout.
  * Clean up functions.R file:
    * PLEASE DO GET RID OF UNUSED FUNCTIONS. Search files for each function (cmd + shift + f). If it does not exist, remove it from functions.R
    * Use clearer function names. It often happens as a project develops that functions become ambiguous in their name. E.g., you have several functions that do similar things (like getting or plotting CIs from psychometric or IO models). Extend their names to be clear: e.g., compare get_CI to get_CI_from_ideal_observer; or make_CI to print_CI; or add_PSE_perception_median to add_PSE_median_to_plot (note how I also removed redundancy since PSEs are always about perception); etc. Rename the functions and use CMD + SHIFT + F to search and replace all mentions of those functions across all files. 
    * Organize functions into sections with headings in functions.R
  * Try to set local constants at top of chunk. e.g., Don't have stuff like empirical_means <- c(17, 62) in the middle of a chunk. 
  

## Medium priority

 * MARYANN
  

  
 * FLORIAN
  * think about table 1 and 2: how to change the wording on tables to actually refer to intercepts rather than PSEs or change the figures? Changing current representations of analyses to improve intuitive-ity. 
  * write overview of results
  * restructure results presentation.
  * write SI sections with proofs
  
### Lower Priority

 * MARYANN
  * Combine data from exposure and test, use all together instead of coding block, code trial and code it as a smooth. That means using GAMM -- that may require taking lapse (try it first without lapses because the GAMM takes care of the lapse. The RE will be expressed differently. It has to follow the GAMM syntax.) The primary thing we want to smooth over is "block", but could theoretically smooth over VOT and Block.

    
 * Florian
  * compare IBBU predictions over blocks with human behavioural data

## To do later
  
  * Everyone: Eat ice-cream and perhaps have a beer.
