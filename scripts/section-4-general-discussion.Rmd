# General discussion
 
Landmark studies employing DL and LGPL and VGPL have qualitatively demonstrated how listeners' speech categorisation change in response to the phonetic properties of the input, providing abundant evidence that support broad claims made by theories for adaptive speech perception.  Few however, have tested the predictions concerning the cumulative and incremental process of adaptation and how the input is integrated with listeners' prior expectations. This study brings those predictions into sharper focus with a novel design that probed listeners categorisation behaviour before exposure and in regular intervals during exposure to the input. In addition, we have quantified listeners' incremental change relative to the predicted changes by an idealized listener who has fully learned the exposure distribution to investigate how far listeners are willing to move from their prior beliefs. 

Broadly, we can summarise the behavioural patterns we found in 4 main points: the first is that listeners changed their categorization behaviour in the direction of the exposure talker's distributional statistics and they did this in an incremental fashion. Second, adaptive changes were front-loaded, that is, the bulk of the total amount of shift in categorization happened within the first third of the exposure phase. Third, listeners did not converge fully on the ideal category boundary, that is adaptation appears to be constrained. Finally, the degree of constraint depended on where the exposure distribution was placed relative to listeners' prior expectations of the test talker's cue realisations (as indicated by their pre-exposure categorisations).

## Adaptation to shifted talker distributions is rapid
Like previous studies on accent adaptation, LGPL, and VGPL we find rapid adaptation to the exposure input. In fewer than 48 trials (taking only the unlabelled trials into account) the three exposure conditions significantly diverged from their identical categorisation functions pre-exposure towards the direction predicted by their respective exposure distributions. As far as DL paradigms are concerned, this is a novel finding because of the convention of assessing listener categorisation only after hundreds of exposure trials [@clayards2008; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2016; @theodore-monto2019]. Unlike in LGPL and VGPL where exposure trials are made up of ambiguous phonetic cues located in a narrow acoustic space and presented in maximally informative contexts, DL exposure trials form full distributions from which listeners need to infer the category membership of each stimulus. The relatively low informativeness of DL engenders the notion that a large number of trials may be required in order for learning to take effect. We did not however find this to be the case. The pace of adaptation (24 labelled trials) we observe in the second test block is comparable to that of LGPL studies which have reported between 4 and 20 labelled exposure trials for detectable differences between groups [@liu-jaeger2018; @cummings-theodore2023; @tzeng2021; @luthra2021]. The effects we report here are however not entirely comparable to LGPL or VGPL studies due to the difference in the scope of behavioural change evaluated post-exposure. Post-exposure categorisation in LGPL paradigms are made along a continuum of steps of ambiguous stimuli selected by the experimenter. LGPL effects thus reflect perceptual changes with respect to stimuli located in a region previously judged to be ambiguous unlike here where we find a wholesale shift along the actual cue continuum. 


## Does adaptation proceed in an incremental and cumulative manner?
  + A more challenging question we have sought to investigate is whether adaptation proceeds incrementally under this paradigm. Past studies [@kleinschmidt-jaeger2015; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2011] have shown that to be the case, to some extent, by using exposure stimuli that fall within a limited ambiguous range between adjacent categories. The pattern of change we found with our exposure stimuli that covers the full extent of a talker's /d/s and /t/s broadly supports the prediction of incrementality as well. However, we also found several complexities in how the different groups responded to exposure which warrant deeper consideration.  
  
  + The +40 condition is where we saw the greatest degree of shift in listener categorisations as well as the strongest evidence for incremental adaptation which certain Bayesian models of inference predict [@kleinschmidt-jaeger2015]. In examining the patterns produced by listeners in the +10 and baseline conditions we find 
  
  This asymmetry in behaviour is best understood when taking into account listener prior belief. 

  
+ A striking pattern of the change between blocks is a very rapid shift in categorization  followed by diminished incremental changes in subsequent test blocks. Indeed, most of the adaptive changes took effect after the first exposure block. This finding is consistent with both models of Bayesian inference and hypotheses that emphasise error-based learning [@olejarczuk2018; @harmon2019; @davis-sohoglu2020] where adaptation is observed in behavioural and neural responses as a result of effort to reduce the disparity between the expected stimulus and the heard stimulus. This difference between expected and actual    
  


## Why do listeners not shift when distribution is shifted leftwards


+ discuss the fact that changes from block to block were largest at the beginning is consistent with the predictions of error-based learning [@sohoglu-davis2016] and Bayesian inference [@kleinschmidt-jaeger2015; for demonstration, see @jaeger2019].

### Does labelling quicken the pace of adaptation?
We did not design the study with a strong hypothesis about labelling given that previous studies found no effect of labelling on DL [@kleinschmidt2015] while studies in LGPL found that disambiguating labels were critical for phonetic adaptation [@norris2003]. What remains unclear is whether labelling could be effective in the earliest moments of exposure particularly for extremely shifted conditions which would presumably be the most challenging for listeners to adapt to. Because we planned for very short blocks of exposure, including labelled trials hedged our position in the event that labelling facilitates quicker DL. This would not interfere with our main experiment goals nor its ecological validity since real-life encounters would present a listener with both labelled and unlabelled input. Although this study does not provide us with conclusive evidence on the effects of labelling on DL, a future study similar in design to the present one, should test how the presence of labelling or the type of labelling could affect the pace of DL.

 + discuss consequences of findings for other accounts (decision-making; normalization)

 
 + could some form of moving window with historical decay explain the findings? On the one hand if the moving window is very small, that would not explain why we do see some *cumulative* changes across blocks (window must be at least 48 + 12 = 60 trials). on the other hand, the qualitative changes in the PSEs and slopes suggest that 12 trials can be enough to change some aspects of the categorisation function. it's thus *possible* that something that ways recent input much more strongly but also considers less recent input beyond 48 trials might explain the overall pattern.
 
<!-- TO DO: take note to make test stimuli relative to exposure stims in your next experiment? -->
 
 + discuss potential that observed adaptation maximizes accuracy under the choice rule. use psychometric function fit during unlabeled exposure trials to calculate *accuracy* (not likelihood) on labeled trials under criterion and under proportional matching decision rules. compare against accuracy if ideal observers categorization functions are used instead.
