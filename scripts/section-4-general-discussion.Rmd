# General discussion
 
Landmark studies employing DL and LGPL and VGPL have qualitatively demonstrated how listeners' speech categorisation change in response to the phonetic properties of the input, providing abundant evidence that support broad claims made by theories for adaptive speech perception.  Few however, have tested the predictions concerning the cumulative and incremental process of adaptation and how the input is integrated with listeners' prior expectations. This study brings those predictions into sharper focus with a novel design that probes listeners categorisation behaviour before exposure and in regular intervals during exposure to the input. In addition, we have quantified listeners' incremental change relative to the predicted changes by an ideal listener who has fully learned the exposure distribution to investigate how far listeners are willing to move from their prior beliefs. 

Like previous studies in accent adaptation, LGPL, and VGPL we find rapid adaptation to the exposure input. In fewer than 48 trials (taking only the unlabelled trials into account) the three exposure conditions significantly diverged from their identical categorisation functions pre-exposure towards the direction predicted by their respective exposure distributions. As far as DL paradigms are concerned, this is a novel finding because of the convention of assessing listener categorisation only after hundreds of exposure trials [@clayards2008; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2016; @theodore-monto2019]. Unlike in LGPL and VGPL where exposure trials are made up of ambiguous phonetic cues located in a narrow acoustic space and presented in maximally informative contexts, DL exposure trials form full distributions from which listeners need to infer the category membership of each stimulus. The relatively low informativeness of DL engenders the notion that a large number of trials may be required in order for learning to take effect. We did not however find this to be the case. The pace of adaptation (24 labelled trials) we observe in the second test block is comparable to that of LGPL studies which have reported between 4 and 20 labelled exposure trials for detectable differences between groups [@liu-jaeger2018; @cummings-theodore2023; @tzeng2021; @luthra2021]. The effects we report here are however not entirely comparable to LGPL or VGPL studies due to the difference in the scope of behavioural change evaluated post-exposure. Post-exposure categorisation in LGPL paradigms are made along a continuum of steps of ambiguous stimuli selected by the experimenter. LGPL effects thus reflect perceptual changes with respect to stimuli located in a region previously judged to be ambiguous unlike here where we find a wholesale shift along the actual cue continuum. 


### evidence that adaptation is cumulative and incremental
  + To the question of whether adaptation proceeds incrementally as predicted by DL models, the strength of evidence in support of this prediction depends on where the test talker's exposure distributions are placed relative to listeners' starting point. We found stronger evidence of incrementality in the +40 condition compared to the baseline and +10 conditions which were both left-shifted. Specifically incrementality was evident in +40 and +10 but not obvious in the baseline condition. 
    + The pattern of change does correspond to the findings of [@kleinschmidt2020; @kleinschmidt-jaeger2016] -- by the end of exposure the resultant categorization did not fully converge on the ideal boundary. 
  + The block-to-block changes of the respective conditions emphasises the link between incremental adaptation and listener prior expectations of cue distributions. In the +40 condition
  Adaptation can proceed incrementally in the direction of the cue shift only, it seems, if it respects the structure of the natural distributions of cues. 
  + Focussing on the +40 rightwards shift, incremental changes was observed in the rightwards boundary shift between test 1 and test 2 and between test 3 and test 2. In test 4 we observed a slight retraction in the boundary but we have no indication whether this represents listeners' refusal to adapt further in spite of the input or if it was part of natural oscillation in boundary estimates given the relatively wider CIs of the estimates in this condition. 
  + The MAP estimate for kappa which is the confidence in prior mean was ~ 240 -- after 144 exposures, the updated mean is still dominated by the prior mean suggesting that it may take more exposure trials for convergence.

### Does labelling quicken the pace of adaptation [this may be moved further down to deprioritise it]
We did not design the study with a strong hypothesis about labelling given that previous studies found no effect of labelling on DL [@kleinschmidt2015] while studies in LGPL found that disambiguating labels were critical for phonetic adaptation [@norris2003]. What remains unclear is whether labelling could be effective in the earliest moments of exposure particularly for extremely shifted conditions which would presumably be the most challenging for listeners to adapt to. Because we planned for very short blocks of exposure, including labelled trials hedged our position in the event that labelling facilitates quicker DL without interfering with our main experiment goals nor its ecological validity since real-life encounters would present a listener with both labelled and unlabelled input. Although this study does not provide us with conclusive evidence on the effects of labelling on DL, a future study similar in design to the present one, should test how the presence of labelling or the type of labelling could affect the pace of DL.


 + discuss rapid adaptation. link to findings from LGPL and VGPL [cummings-theodore; lj18,19]
 + discuss fast-then-slow adaptation. link to findings in VGPL [kj11, 12, K20] 
 + discuss other evidence for constraints in DL work [kj16; k20], potentially also limits in vroomen 07, kj12 though these are harder to compare.

 + discuss the fact that changes from block to block were largest at the beginning is consistent with the predictions of error-based learning [@sohoglu-davis2016] and Bayesian inference [@kleinschmidt-jaeger2015; for demonstration, see @jaeger2019].
 + discuss consequences of findings for other accounts (decision-making; normalization)

 
 + could some form of moving window with historical decay explain the findings? On the one hand if the moving window is very small, that would not explain why we do see some *cumulative* changes across blocks (window must be at least 48 + 12 = 60 trials). on the other hand, the qualitative changes in the PSEs and slopes suggest that 12 trials can be enough to change some aspects of the categorisation function. it's thus *possible* that something that ways recent input much more strongly but also considers less recent input beyond 48 trials might explain the overall pattern.
 
<!-- TO DO: take note to make test stimuli relative to exposure stims in your next experiment? -->
 
 + discuss potential that observed adaptation maximizes accuracy under the choice rule. use psychometric function fit during unlabeled exposure trials to calculate *accuracy* (not likelihood) on labeled trials under criterion and under proportional matching decision rules. compare against accuracy if ideal observers categorization functions are used instead.
