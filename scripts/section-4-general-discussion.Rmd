# General discussion
 
 + discuss consequences of findings for other accounts (decision-making; normalization)
 
 + discuss potential that observed adaptation maximizes accuracy under the choice rule. use psychometric function fit during unlabeled exposure trials to calculate *accuracy* (not likelihood) on labeled trials under criterion and under proportional matching decision rules. compare against accuracy if ideal observers categorization functions are used instead.


## Methodological advances that can move the field forward
