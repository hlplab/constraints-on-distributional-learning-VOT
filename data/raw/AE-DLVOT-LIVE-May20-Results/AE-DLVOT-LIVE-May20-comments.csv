346,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockC,"I tried to start the experiment in firefox at first, but it didn't load perhaps because java wasn't enabled. I refreshed and got an error message. I then was able to load the experiment in chrome. I acknowledged at the start that you could reject me for reloading, but I assume because I didn't actually reload the experiment (it hadn't started yet) that you could use my data. I hope this is the case because I only loaded this experiment once. ",
