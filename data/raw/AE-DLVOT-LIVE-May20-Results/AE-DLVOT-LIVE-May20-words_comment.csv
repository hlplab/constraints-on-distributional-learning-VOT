273,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockB,"No, not really.",
363,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockB,"It felt like at times she was trying to slur the words, at least it was very hard to tell some of them from the other. But that could have been because of her accent.",
303,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockB,,
374,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockB,She made sure to say both types of words like till and dill very similar.,
206,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockB,"I feel like she tried putting too much emphasis on the t and d sometimes and it made them sound similar to eachother. Sometimes they very clearly said till or dill, others it sounded like tdill/dtill. When they were more relaxed it was clear. ",
297,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockB,"It was sometimes difficult to decide if the speaker said ""t"" or ""d"", sometimes if was more obvious.. ",
241,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockB,"Sometimes with the words dip and tip, and dill and till, it was hard to make out whether she was pronouncing it with a T or D. Sometimes I felt like it could have been either word.",
185,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockB,It was sometimes very difficult to tell the difference between two similar words ,
389,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockB,"Most words sounded like they were pronounced mostly correctly, but I can see how some listeners can misinterpret.",
196,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockB,"There was a vague accent and in some instances, the t/d phoneme seemed slurred to be a combination of both",
279,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockB,There was nothing unusual that stook out to me about how the speaker pronounced the words.,
261,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockB,some letter sounds had more emphasis ,
271,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockB,"No, I didn't notice anything in particular.",
289,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockB,very sternly,
331,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockB,words with a D were quicker where as words beginning with a T were slower,
361,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockB,I felt like it was common that some of the d's would more often sound like t's than the other way around. ,
195,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockB,"No, I don't think so. I think the most similar sounding consonants are t and d, or at least the way she was pronouncing them. I think I got the majority correct.",
315,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockB,no,
165,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockA,I felt that the words dill and till were the most difficult to differentiate between the two when they were the two choices. I think share/flare/rare were quite easy to tell the difference between.  ,
254,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockA,some words were easier to determine than others. it was sometimes hard to differentiate between a t and a d sound.,
330,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockA,"When the speaker pronounces her T's, the speaker first lets out a small burst of pressured air by clamping her tongue and teeth together and leaving a small opening when she exhales. ",
306,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockA,"Occasionally, it sounded like she said din when my choices were tin or till",
231,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockA,"Sometimes hers d's and t's sounded distinct, but sometimes they sounded like a dt blend.",
319,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockA,,
353,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockA,"The speaker didn't seem to pronounce the ""t"" and I noticed that the ""d"" was pronounced in some words only.  It did sound a bit synthesized.",
270,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockA,I didn't notice anything odd.,
193,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockA,not really,
340,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockA,"They barely say the ""D"" noise when words start with them but they very strongly accentuate the ""T"" noise.",
209,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockA,"Sometimes it was very ambiguous with dill, till, dip and tip.",
228,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockA,"Occasionally the ""t"" seemed to be swallowed or pronounced with less forward motion of the tongue.",
313,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockA, very precise in pronunciation,
204,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockA,"some times the beginning d & t sounded the same, but the ending letters were always clear.",
277,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockA,seemed like the d was weak sometimes. I had trouble telling if it was a weak d or a low volume t.,
269,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockA,,
220,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockA,I think she put a bit more emphasis on each begining and ending. ,
321,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockA,,
174,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockC,No,
262,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockC,"The initial consonant was not always pronounced the same.  It may have played ""dill"" several times in a row but each ""dill"" did not sound identical.",
372,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockC,"Sometimes the t and d sounded similar, sharper d instead of soft. The speaker put emphasis on different parts of the word.",
359,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockC,"I could usually tell which word was being spoken, but sometimes it sounded like a blend of the two words was being spoken. I feel like it was typical American pronunciation which made this easier for me. ",
345,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockC,Nothing in particular. It sounded like standard English to me.,
376,Shift40_bwd_ExpBlockC,I didn't notice anything in particular.,
384,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockC,"I had a few times where the speaker clearly said a word that was not listed for example speaker said dill and my choices were till or tin, in these cases I chose the word that was closest to the spoken word so in my example I would have chosen till for the spoken word dill, I'm not sure if this was intentional or an error so I just thought I would mention it. As for the pronunciation itself I didn't notice anything out of the normal.",
176,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockC,"You could tell that there was a slight accent, particularly on words like 'till' and 'dill', and that might've been where much of my attention drifted to.",
375,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockC,The speaker pronounced their t and d sounds very similar at times.,
329,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockC,Sometimes it seemed to be in-between a D sound and a T sound. I tried to pick the closest one. ,
181,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockC,"I can't remember which word it was but for some words whenever it would be something like ""till"" as an option, it would sound like she's saying ""dill"" but that wasn't an option in some cases.",
388,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockC,Not really,
154,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockA,"No, I did not",
327,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockA,,
349,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockA,Ts and Ds were very similar/not always anunciated.,
326,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockA,"No, I did not. She sounded very normal to me. ",
246,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockA,They all seemed pretty straight forward.,
229,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockA,I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. But maybe they were of Asian descent,
282,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockA,"it mostly sounded pretty much how I expected, sometimes it was hard to distinguish between d and t but I think that was the point",
286,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockA,a bit at times the same words sounded a bit different than before,
307,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockA,No,
336,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockA,"Sometimes it was really hard to tell but I thought I could make out a distinct ""T"" or D"" sound.",
356,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockA,"Word endings seemed to be exaggerated for some words. Emphasis on ""ill"" and ""ip"" sounds.",
256,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockA,Some words sounded more metallic than others.,
211,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockA,,
304,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockC,I think that when it they pronounced certain words that start with t or d they made the first letter more accented in some cases to make it easier to distinguish between the two.,
233,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockC,Till/dill and tin/din were both very similar in pronunciation. Tip/Dip she seemed to do a harder d so it was easier to identify,
260,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockC,no,
357,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockC,"Some were very clearly a T or a D, others were more ambiguous.",
346,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockC,She was able to pronounce the 't and d' words three ways (at least) so that one sounded ambiguous while the other two were easier to identify,
169,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockC,"Some of the pronunciations sounded more similar to each other (meaning it was more ambiguous) and others sounded very clear, especially with till vs dill. The T and D sounded similar in some of the recordings.",
167,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockC,"The speaker seemed to cut off words sharply, especially those that ended in ""p"" like ""dip"" and ""tip."" ",
238,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockC,"Not really, some of the time the words sounded more distinct and sometimes they sounded more ambiguous  ",
203,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockC,I think the pronunciation was very clear and easy to understand.,
281,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockC,Sometimes the distinction between something like till vs dill was clear. Other times it was a bit trickier to distinguish.,
180,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockC,"I felt that she stressed certain letters too much, which made it a little easier. For example, when she said ""Dip,"" sometimes she put a lot of stress on the D and/or the P, which gave it away more easily.",
335,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockB,Sometimes I got lost in the t and d and second guessed myself as to what I heard. They sounded so much alike that I couldn't tell them apart. ,
227,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockB,"The dill words were pronounced ""Duh-ill"" where the till was pronounced more ""t-ill""",
295,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockB,"The speaker pronounced till as dill and vice-versa when paired with other words. Same thing with tin and din, ",
348,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockB,,
201,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockB,Words blended into each other. L's and P's got confused.,
155,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockB,I seemed to notice a sort of s sound in front of the harder to determine t sounds.  That's how I tried to determine if the muddier consonant sounds were d or t.,
187,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockA,"the ""ll"" sound was drawn out slightly longer than expected.",
251,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockA,nothing unusual. maybe pronounced the ending kind of sharply,
259,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockA,"There were times where it seemed a combination of the T and D sounds at the beginning of words, so you have to make your best approximation. Also at times the beginning of the words seemed to disappear, only leaving the remainder of the word. ",
339,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockA,The words till and dill sounded different at the end and like the speaker might have an Asian accent. ,
177,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockA,no,
354,Shift0_bwd_ExpBlockA,I did not notice anything unusual about pronunciation.,
317,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockC,The speaker place more emphasis on the T than the D. ,
334,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockC,"The t and d sound was very similar, the T or D wasn't very annunciated as someone would normally speak",
392,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockC,"Most times, the 'D' and ""T"" sounds in dill and till were distinguishable, but sometimes I could not tell the difference, and it may be due to a different dialect.",
164,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockC,"The speaker that I found slightly hard to understand sounded like they spoke with a South Asian Accent. I assume within the context of a sentence it would be easy to understand them, but with only standalone words it was tough. I can't be sure I got a single ""tin"" or ""din"" from that speaker right. ",
175,Shift10_bwd_ExpBlockC,No,
156,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockB,"a lot of the ""t"" sounds sounded like ""d's"" to me.",
347,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockB,Was their tin and din sounded too similar ,
245,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockB,The pronunciation of some words sometimes sounded inhuman and unusual,
160,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockB,"I believe so. Many times I couldn't tell whether she said d or t. Sometimes it sounded as though she was pronouncing a d, but making it sound like a t and vice versa. ",
179,Shift0_fwd_ExpBlockB,"Their ""t"" sometimes sounded like ""d"" but not always.",
205,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockC,No differences noticed.  ,
395,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockC,it sound like a slight stutter to the voice,
243,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockC,I thought a couple of time there was the word dill and dip. It sounded like bill so I went with the word dill. I noticed a couple of the d's sounded like a b.,
390,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockC,Sometimes the speaker sounded like she could've said either word that was similar to itself such as till and dill which was hard to make out the sound sometimes.,
373,Shift40_fwd_ExpBlockC,Some words seemed to be badly or oddly enunciated,
296,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockB,,
232,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockB,"No, I just found that the speaker pronounced many of the words very similarly to one another. ",
393,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockB, the hardest ones for myself seemed to be din,
189,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockB,sometimes it was hard to tell the d apart from the t.,
338,Shift10_fwd_ExpBlockB,"Dill and Till were kind of difficult.  More than Din and Tin, although I had occasionally had trouble with those as well.  Thanks for this opportunity",
